‚öñÔ∏è Trade-Offs & Decisions
Context API for Auth: Simpler than Redux/Zustand for small-scale auth state.

React Query: Chosen for caching, refetching, and simplified API state management.

React Toastify: Provides a polished notification system with minimal setup.

Client-Side Pagination: Implemented due to API constraints; could migrate to server-side later.
